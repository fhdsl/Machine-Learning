# Machine Learning

## Learning Objectives

-   **Compare** machine learning models in terms of flexibility vs. interpretability.
-   **Compare** machine learning model performance in terms of bias and variance trade-off.
-   **Implement** **and Interpret** models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and lasso using a Tidy dataset via existing packages such as Sklearn and Statsmodels.
-   **Evaluate** model performance metrics for inference and prediction, such as AIC, BIC, MSE, and AUC, under a cross validated framework if appropriate.
-   **Explain** the difference in machine learning techniques between low and high dimensional data.
