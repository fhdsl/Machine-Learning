# Problem Set-Up

*In the first week of class, we will go over...*

Suppose that we are given the [**N**ational **H**ealth **A**nd **N**utrition **E**xamination **S**urvey (NHANES) dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/) and want to build a machine learning model to predict a person's blood pressure based on clinical and demographic variables.

Using algebraic expressions, we formulate the following:

$$
BloodPressure=f(Age, BMI, Income, ...)+\epsilon 
$$

Where $f(Age, BMI, Income, ...)$ is a machine learning model that takes in the clinical and demographic variables and make a prediction on the $BloodPressure$. This model is not perfect to give a perfect, correct prediction, so there is an "error term" $\epsilon$ that captures the imperfectness of the model.

A machine learning model, such as the one described above, has *two main uses:*

-   **Prediction:** How accurately can we predict outcomes?

-   **Inference:** Which predictors are associated with the response, and how strong is the association?
