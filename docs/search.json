We see that we have a fitted line in blue for every value of BMI, which represents our machine learning model \\(f(BMI)\\). This model is called Logistic Regression.\nThe first thing we want to investigate about this model is how well it performs in terms of Classification. Just using \\(BMI\\) as a variable, what is the Accuracy of \\(f(BMI)\\) classifying whether a person has \\(Hypertension\\)? Notice that first \\(f(BMI)\\) gives us continuous probability values, such as given a BMI of 30, there is a 20% chance the person has Hypertension. We need a discrete cutoff of this model to decide whether the person has Hypertension.\nA reasonable cutoff to start is 50%: if the probability of having Hypertension is &gt;=50%, then classify that person having Hypertension. Same for &lt; 50%. This is called the Decision Boundary.\nplt.clf()\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, logit_model.predict(), color=\"blue\", label=\"Fitted Line\")\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, y, alpha=.3, color=\"brown\", label=\"Data\")\nplt.xlabel('BMI')\nplt.ylabel('Probability of Hypertension')\nplt.axhline(y=0.5, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Prediction Cutoff')\nplt.legend();\nplt.show()\nGiven this decision boundary, what is the accuracy?\nprediction_cut = [1 if x &gt;= .5 else 0 for x in logit_model.predict()]\nprint('Accuracy = ', accuracy_score(y, prediction_cut)) \n\nAccuracy =  0.762300186838281\nOkay, that’s a starting point!\nWe can break down classification accuracy to four additional results:\ntn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y, prediction_cut).ravel().tolist()\nprint(\"True Positive:\", tp, \"\\nFalse Positive: \", fp, \"\\nTrue Negative: \", tn, \"\\nFalse Negative:\", fn)\n\nTrue Positive: 109 \nFalse Positive:  137 \nTrue Negative:  7235 \nFalse Negative: 2153\ndefine tp, fp, tn, fn\ndefine confusion matrix\ncm = confusion_matrix(y, prediction_cut) \nprint(\"Confusion Matrix : \\n\", cm) \n\nConfusion Matrix : \n [[7235  137]\n [2153  109]]",

    "text": "2.2 Review of Data Structures\nWe will be seeing a lot of different data structures in this course beyond DataFrames, Series, and Lists. So let’s review how we think about learning new data structures to make our lives easier when we encounter new data structures.\nLet’s review the List data structure. For any data structure, we ask the following:\n\nWhat does it contain (in terms of data)?\nWhat can it do (in terms of functions)?\n\nAnd if it “makes sense” to us, then it is well-designed data structure.\nFormally, a data structure in Python (also known as an Object) may contain the following:\n\nValue that holds the essential data for the data structure.\nAttributes that hold subset or additional data for the data structure.\nFunctions called Methods that are for the data structure and have to take in the variable referenced as an input.\n\nLet’s see how this applies to the List:\n\nValue: the contents of the list, such as [2, 3, 4].\nAttributes that store additional values: Not relevant for lists.\nMethods that can be used on the object: my_list.append(x)\n\nHow about Dataframe?\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional spreadsheet of the dataframe.\nAttributes that store additional values: df.shape gives the number of rows and columns. df.my_col_name access the column called “my_col_name”.\nMethods that can be used on the object: df.merge(other_df, on=“column_name”)\n\nFeel free to look at the cheatsheet on data structures from Intro to Python to refresh yourself.\n\n2.2.1 NumPy\nA new Data Structure we will work with in this course is NumPy’s ndarray (“n-dimensional array”) data structure. It is commonly referred as “NumPy Array”. It is very similar to a Dataframe, but has the following characteristics for building machine learning models:\n\nAll elements are homogeneous and numeric.\nThere are no column or row names.\nMathematical operations are optimized to be fast.\n\nSo, let’s see some examples:\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional numerical table. It actually can be any dimension, but we will just work with 1-dimensional (similar to a List) and 2-dimensional.\nAttributes that store additional values:\n\nTwo-dimensional subsetting, similar to lists: data[:5, :3] subsets for for the first 5 rows and first three columns. data[:5, [0, 2, 3]] subsets for the first 5 rows and 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns.\ndata.shape gives the shape of the NumPy Array. data.ndim will tell you the number of dimensions of the NumPy Array.\n\nMethods that can be used on the object:\n\ndata.sum(axis=0) sums over rows, data.sum(axis=1) sums over columns.\n\n\nFor this course, we often load in a dataset in the Pandas Dataframe format, and then once we pick the our outcome and predictors, we will transform the Dataframe into an NumPy Array, such as this line of code we saw earlier: y, X = model_matrix(\"Hypertension ~ BMI\", nhanes). We specify our outcome, predictor, and Dataframe for the model_matrix() function, and the outputs are two NumPy Arrays, one for the outcome, and one for the predictors. Any downstream Machine Learning modeling work off the NumPy Arrays y and X.\nMore introduction can be found on NumPy’s tutorial guide.\n\n\n2.2.2 What is this data structure?\nIf you are not sure about what your variable’s data structure, use the type() function, such as type(mystery_data) and it will tell you.",

We will refresh this quickly in the context of our problem. Recall the following definitions:\nPopulation: The entire collection of individual units that a researcher is interested to study. For NHANES, this could be the entire US population.\nSample: A smaller collection of individual units that the researcher has selected to study. For NHANES, this could be a random sampling of the US population.\nIn Machine Learning problems, we often like to take two, non-overlapping samples from the population: the Training Set, and the Test Set. We train our model using the Training Set, which gives us a function \\(f()\\) that relates the predictors to the outcome. Then, for 2 main use cases:\nIf the concepts of population, sample, estimation, p-value, and confidence interval is new to you, we recommend do a bit of reading here https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance.",

    "text": "3.2 Generalizability of a model\nWhen we look how the model performs in Classification and Prediction on the training and test data, we are asking how generalizable a model is. Usually we want our model to perform well on unseen, testing data that also represent the population.\nWe saw that in the first exercise, the Training and Testing Error looked different - why?\n\nThere is always going to be some variation, because Training and Test are samples from the population, as we discussed above.\nThe model was trained on the Training Set, so the prediction is going to naturally perform better than data it has never seen before on the Testing Set.\n\nHow do we interpret the difference between Training Error and Testing Error?\n\n\nTo see how generalizable a model is, let’s look at a problem in prediction, not classification. The underlying principles of model generalizability applies to both prediction and classification, but it is generally easier to visualize this concept in prediction models.\n\n3.2.1 Underfitting and Overfitting a Prediction Model\nIn a prediction model, the outcome is continuous. Instead of yes/no for \\(Hyptertension\\), we will use the clinical metric to \\(BloodPressure\\), which is a formula based on ____. The prediction model we will use is called a Linear Model, in its basic form draws a straight line as a line of “best fit” for given the data.\nTo evaluate the model, we will let the model make prediction given the input variable. This prediction is on the scale of \\(BloodPressure\\), so there’s no to draw a Decision Boundary in prediction problems. To examine the accuracy, we will look at the mean squared error between the true \\(BloodPressure\\) and the predicted \\(BloodPressure\\).

This is an example of Underfitting, where our model failed to capture the complexity of the data in both the Training and Testing Set.\nAfter degree 6, we see that the Training Error is low, but the Testing Error is huge! This is an example of Overfitting, in which our model fitted the shape of of the training set so well that it fails to generalize to the testing set.\n\nWe want to find a model that is “just right” that doesn’t underfit or overfit the data. Usually, as the model becomes more flexible, the Training Error keeps lowering, and the Testing Error will lower a bit before increasing. It seems that our ideal prediction model is around a polynomial of degree 5 or 6, with the minimal Testing Error.\nHere is another illustration of the phenomena, using synthetic controlled data:\nOn the left shows the Training Data in black dots. Then, three models are displayed: linear regression (orange line), two other models of increasing complexity in blue and green.\nOn the right shows the training error (grey curve), testing error (red curve), and where each of the three models on the left land in the error rate with their respective colors.\n\n\n\nSource: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Ch. 2, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Roebert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor.\n\n\nLastly, we recommend examining interactive tutorial: https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/\nHopefully you start to see the importance of examining the Testing Error instead of the Training Error to evaluate our model. A highly flexible data will overfit the model and make it seem like the Training Error is small, but it will not generalize to the Testing data, which will have Testing Error.\n\n\n3.2.2 Underfitting and Overfitting a Classification Model\nLet’s do the same exercise for a Classification model.

    "text": "3.3 Inference\nNow let’s examine the function \\(f()\\)’s trained values, which are called parameters.\n\n3.3.1 Linear Model\nFor the Linear Model, the model we first fitted was of the following form:\n\\[\nBloodPressure=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot BMI\n\\]\nwhich is an equation of a line.\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is a parameter describing the intercept of the line, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is a parameter describing the slope of the line.\nSuppose that from fitting the model on the Training Set, \\(\\beta_1=2\\). That means increasing \\(BMI\\) by 1 will lead to an increase of \\(BloodPressure\\) by 2. This measures the strength of association between a variable and the outcome.\nLet’s see this in practice:\n\ny, X = model_matrix(\"BloodPressure ~ BMI\", nhanes_tiny)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)\nlinear_model = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train).fit()\n\nlinear_model.summary()\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

We also see associated standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals. This is necessarily to report and interpret because we derive these parameters based on a sample of the data (train or test set), so there are statistical uncertainties associated with them. For instance, the 95% confidence interval of true population parameter will fall between (.22, .87).\n\n\n3.3.2 Logistic Regression\nLet’s do the same for our Logic Regression Classifier model, which has an equation of:\n\\[\n\\frac{p(Hypertension)}{1-p(Hypertension)}=e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot BMI}\n\\]\nOn the left hand side of the equationis the Odds of having Hypertension.\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is a parameter describing __, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is a parameter describing ___\n\ny, X = model_matrix(\"Hypertension ~ BMI\", nhanes_tiny)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)\nlogit_model = sm.Logit(y_train, X_train).fit()\n\nlogit_model.summary()\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.485168\n         Iterations 6\n\n\n\nLogit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.
