The course is also appropriate for scientists and clinicians who are interested to communicate with data scientists to understand the ins and outs of a machine learning problem. The pre-requisites for the course is Intro to Python, or being able to use Lists and Pandas Dataframes to manipulate data. Basic knowledge of statistics, such as hypothesis testing and p-values, is also strongly recommended.",

You will be able to implement several popular machine learning techniques based on the question of interest and the dataset at hand. You will then evaluate the model based on their performance and diagnostics to understand its strengths and limitations. Technical mathematics and algorithms will not be emphasized.",
