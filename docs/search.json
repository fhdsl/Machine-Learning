    "text": "2.1 Classification model example\nSuppose that we are given the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and want to build a machine learning model to classify whether a person has hypertension blood pressure based on clinical and demographic variables.\nUsing algebraic expressions, we formulate the following:\n\\[\nHypertension=f(Age, BMI)\n\\]\nWhere \\(f(Age, BMI)\\) is a machine learning model that takes in the variables \\(Age\\), \\(BMI\\), and make a classification on whether someone has \\(Hypertension\\).\nA machine learning model, such as the one described above, has two main uses:\nLet’s start with the easiest case for just \\(Hypertension = f(Age)\\), a single predictor.\nBefore we fit models, we often visualize the data to get a sense whether our setup makes sense.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom formulaic import model_matrix\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nnhanes = pd.read_csv(\"classroom_data/NHANES.csv\")\nnhanes['Hypertension'] = (nhanes['BPDiaAve'] &gt; 80) | (nhanes['BPSysAve'] &gt; 130)\n\nnhanes['Hypertension2'] = nhanes['Hypertension'].replace({True: \"Hypertension\", False: \"No Hypertension\"})\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.boxplot(y=\"Hypertension2\", x=\"BMI\", data=nhanes)\nax.set_ylabel('')\nplt.show()\nOkay, great, it looks like when someone’s BMI is higher, then it is more likely that the person has Hypertension.\nNow, let’s build the model \\(Hypertension = f(BMI)\\) to make a prediction of \\(Hyptertension\\) given \\(BMI\\).\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom formulaic import model_matrix\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nnhanes = pd.read_csv(\"classroom_data/NHANES.csv\")\nnhanes['Hypertension'] = (nhanes['BPDiaAve'] &gt; 80) | (nhanes['BPSysAve'] &gt; 130)\n\ny, X = model_matrix(\"Hypertension ~ BMI\", nhanes)\nlogit_model = sm.Logit(y, X).fit() \n\nplt.clf()\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, logit_model.predict(), color=\"blue\", label=\"Fitted Line\")\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, y, alpha=.3, color=\"brown\", label=\"Data\")\nplt.xlabel('BMI')\nplt.ylabel('Probability of Hypertension')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.515543\n         Iterations 6\nInstead of boxplots, we plotted the data just using points, with “Hypertension” having a probability of 1 and “No Hypertension” having a probability of 0. We see that we have a fitted line in blue for every value of BMI, which represents our machine learning model \\(f(BMI)\\). This model is called Logistic Regression.\nThe first thing we want to investigate about this model is how well it performs in terms of Classification. Just using \\(BMI\\) as a variable, what is the Accuracy of \\(f(BMI)\\) classifying whether a person has \\(Hypertension\\)? Notice that first \\(f(BMI)\\) gives us continuous probability values, such as given a BMI of 30, there is a 20% chance the person has Hypertension. We need a discrete cutoff of this model to decide whether the person has Hypertension.\nA reasonable cutoff to start is 50%: if the probability of having Hypertension is &gt;=50%, then classify that person having Hypertension. Same for &lt; 50%. This is called the Decision Boundary.\nplt.clf()\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, logit_model.predict(), color=\"blue\", label=\"Fitted Line\")\nplt.scatter(X.BMI, y, alpha=.3, color=\"brown\", label=\"Data\")\nplt.xlabel('BMI')\nplt.ylabel('Probability of Hypertension')\nplt.axhline(y=0.5, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Prediction Cutoff')\nplt.legend();\nplt.show()\nGiven this decision boundary, what is the accuracy?\nfrom sklearn.metrics import (confusion_matrix, accuracy_score)\n\nprediction_cut = [1 if x &gt;= .5 else 0 for x in logit_model.predict()]\nprint('Accuracy = ', accuracy_score(y, prediction_cut)) \n\nAccuracy =  0.762300186838281\nOkay, that’s a starting point!\nWe can break down classification accuracy to four additional results:\ntn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y, prediction_cut).ravel().tolist()\nprint(\"True Positive:\", tp, \"\\nFalse Positive: \", fp, \"\\nTrue Negative: \", tn, \"\\nFalse Negative:\", fn)\n\nTrue Positive: 109 \nFalse Positive:  137 \nTrue Negative:  7235 \nFalse Negative: 2153\ndefine tp, fp, tn, fn\ndefine confusion matrix\ncm = confusion_matrix(y, prediction_cut) \nprint(\"Confusion Matrix : \\n\", cm) \n\nConfusion Matrix : \n [[7235  137]\n [2153  109]]",

    "text": "2.2 Review of Data Structures\nWe will be seeing a lot of different data structures in this course beyond DataFrames, Series, and Lists. So let’s review how we think about learning new data structures to make our lives easier when we encounter new data structures.\nLet’s review the List data structure. For any data structure, we ask the following:\n\nWhat does it contain (in terms of data)?\nWhat can it do (in terms of functions)?\n\nAnd if it “makes sense” to us, then it is well-designed.\nThe list data structure we have been working with is an example of an Object. The definition of an object allows us to ask the questions above: what does it contain, and what can it do? It is an organizational tool for a collection of data and functions that we can relate to, like a physical object. Formally, an object contains the following:\n\nValue that holds the essential data for the object.\nAttributes that hold subset or additional data for the object.\nFunctions called Methods that are for the object and have to take in the variable referenced as an input.\n\nThis organizing structure on an object applies to pretty much all Python data types and data structures.\nLet’s see how this applies to the List:\n\nValue: the contents of the list, such as [2, 3, 4].\nAttributes that store additional values: Not relevant for lists.\nMethods that can be used on the object: my_list.append(x)\n\nHow about Dataframe?\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional spreadsheet of the dataframe.\nAttributes that store additional values: df.shape gives the number of rows and columns. df.my_col_name access the column called “my_col_name”.\nMethods that can be used on the object: df.merge(other_df, on=“column_name”)\n\nFeel free to look at the cheatsheet on data structures from Intro to Python.\n\n2.2.1 NumPy\nA new Data Structure we will work with in this course is NumPy’s ndarray data structure. It is very similar to a Dataframe, but has the following characteristics for building machine learning models:\n\nAll elements are homogeneous and numeric.\nThere are no column or row labels.\nMathematical operations are optimized\n\nSo, let’s see some examples:\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional numerical table. It actually can go up to n-dimensions.\nAttributes that store additional values:\n\n\n\nMethods that can be used on the object:",

    "section": "2.3 Population and Sample",
    "text": "2.3 Population and Sample\nThe way we formulate machine learning model is based on some fundamental concepts in inferential statistics. We will refresh this quickly in the context of our problem. Recall the following definitions:\nPopulation: The entire collection of individual units that a researcher is interested to study. For NHANES, this could be the entire US population.\nSample: A smaller collection of individual units that the researcher has selected to study. For NHANES, this could be a random sampling of the US population.\nIn Machine Learning problems, we often like to take two, non-overlapping samples from the population: the Training Set, and the Test Set. We train our model using the Training Set, which gives us a function \\(f()\\) that relates the predictors to the outcome. Then, for our main use cases:\n\nPrediction: We use the trained model to predict the outcome using predictors from the Test Set and compare to the true value in the Test Set.\nInference: We examine the function \\(f()\\)’s trained values, which are called parameters. For instance, \\(f(Age,BMI,Income)=20 + 3 \\cdot Age - .2 \\cdot BMI + .00015 \\cdot Income\\), the values \\(20\\), \\(3\\), \\(-.2\\), and \\(.00015\\) are the parameters. Because these parameters are derived from the Training Set, they are an estimated quantity from a sample, similar to other summary statistics like the mean of a sample. Therefore, to say anything about the true population, we have to use statistical tools such as p-values and confidence intervals.\n\nIf the concepts of population, sample, estimation, p-value, and confidence interval is new to you, we recommend do a bit of reading here [todo].",

    "text": "2.4 How to evaluate and pick a model?\nThe little example model we showcased above is an example of a linear model, but we will look at several types of models in this course. In order to decide how to evaluate and pick a model, we will need to develop a framework to assess a model. Let’s start with the use case of prediction.\n\n2.4.1 Prediction\nSuppose we try to use the single variable \\(BMI\\) to predict \\(BloodPressure\\) using a linear model.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom formulaic import model_matrix\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nnhanes = pd.read_csv(\"classroom_data/NHANES.csv\")\nnhanes['BloodPressure'] = nhanes['BPDiaAve'] + (nhanes['BPSysAve'] - nhanes['BPDiaAve']) / 3 \n\ny, X = model_matrix(\"BloodPressure ~ BMI\", nhanes)\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()\n\nplt.plot(X_train.BMI, results.fittedvalues, label=\"fitted line\")\nplt.scatter(X_train.BMI, y_train, alpha=.3, color=\"brown\", label=\"training set\")\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe examine how well our model performs in terms of prediction by seeing how close our model’s predicted \\(BloodPressure\\) is to the Training Set’s true \\(BloodPressure\\): the Training Error. We also take the model to the Testing Set to predict \\(BloodPressure\\) using predictors from the Test Set and compare to the true \\(BloodPressure\\) in the Test Set: the Testing Error. We want the model’s Training Error to be adequately small on the Training Set, but what we really care about is the Testing Error, because it is a true test of how the model performs on unseen, new data, and allows us to see how generalizeable the model is.\nOkay, let’s how it does on the Training Set:\n\nnp.mean((results.fittedvalues - y_train.BloodPressure) ** 2)\n\nnp.float64(152.36993639963026)\n\n\n\nresults.mse_resid\n\nnp.float64(152.44179206404883)\n\n\n[graph here]\nAnd then on the Test Set:\n\nnp.mean((results.get_prediction(X_test).predicted_mean - y_test.BloodPressure) ** 2)\n\nnp.float64(155.83019738256448)\n\n\n\nplt.plot(X_test.BMI, results.get_prediction(X_test).predicted_mean, label=\"fitted line\")\nplt.scatter(X_test.BMI, y_test, alpha=.3, color=\"black\", label=\"test set\")\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the Training Error is fairly high, and the Testing Error is even higher. This is an example of Underfitting, where our model failed to capture the complexity of the data in both the Training and Testing Set.\nLet’s return to the drawing board and fit a new type of model that has more flexibility around complicated patterns of data. Let’s see how it does on the Training Set:\n\n#y, X = model_matrix(\"BloodPressure ~ poly(BMI, degree=5)\", nhanes)\n\n#X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)\n#model = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train)\n#results = model.fit()\n#results.summary()\n\n#plt.plot(X_train.BMI, results.fittedvalues, label=\"fitted line\")\n#plt.scatter(X_train.BMI, y_train, alpha=.3, color=\"brown\", label=\"training set\")\n#plt.legend();\n\n[graph here]\nAnd then on the Test Set:\n[graph here]\nWe see that the Training Error is low, but the Testing Error is huge! This is an example of Overfitting, in which our model fitted the shape of of the training set so well that it fails to generalize to the testing set.\nWe want to find a model that is “just right” that doesn’t underfit or overfit the data. Usually, as the model becomes more flexible, the Training Error keeps lowering, and the Testing Error will lower a bit before increasing. See below:\n\n\n\nSource: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Ch. 2, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Roebert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor.\n\n\nAlso see this interactive tutorial: https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/\n\n\n2.4.2 Inference\nLet’s consider how we would evaluate and choose models for Inference.\nFor models with low number of predictors, there are some plots and metrics one would consider, such as BIC.\nFor models with high number of predictors, we will talk about it in more detail in weeks 5 & 6.\nBesides how flexible a model is, another categorization of machine models is how interpretable they are. The more interpretable a model is, the better one can describe how each variable has an predictor of the model. That makes the inference process easier.\nBelow are some example models mapped to these two dichotomies. The linear model lies very similar as the “Least Squares” models.\n\n\n\nSource: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Ch. 2, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Roebert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor",
