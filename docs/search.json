    "text": "2.1 An conceptual example\nSuppose that we are given the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and want to build a machine learning model to predict a person’s Mean Blood Pressure (also known as Mean Arterial Pressure), which is related to person’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures. The Mean Arterial Pressure is our Response Variable or Outcome we wish to make predictions on, given Predictor Variables we have in the NHANES dataset. We have ~70 predictors we can consider, some of which include: Age, BMI, Average Number of Hours Slept, Gender, Income, Highest Education, Martial Status, Mental health questionnaires, and so forth.\nSuppose that we decide to use the predictors \\(Age\\) and \\(BMI\\) for our machine learning model, and formulate it algebraically:\n\\[\nMeanBloodPressure=f(Age, BMI)\n\\]\nWhere \\(f(Age, BMI)\\) is a machine learning model that takes in the predictors \\(Age\\), \\(BMI\\), and make a prediction on one’s \\(MeanBloodPressure\\). The predictor’s value is almost always known, and the response is not, which gives us our problem making sound predictions. The process of machine learning is figuring out the appropriate function \\(f()\\). For example,\n\\[\nMeanBloodPressure= 20 + 3 \\cdot Age - .2 \\cdot BMI\n\\]\nHow did we arrive at this equation form and the numbers \\(20\\), \\(3\\), and \\(-.2\\)? They were estimated from the data as well as some assumptions of the equation form to be Linear.\nGiven this model, suppose are given a person’s \\(Age\\) to be 30 and \\(BMI\\) to be 34. Then, we can make a prediction using this model:\n\\[\nMeanBloodPressure=20 + 3 \\cdot Age - .2 \\cdot BMI = 103.2\n\\]\nTo see how accurate our prediction is, we can compare our predicted response to the true response, if we have the data for that. That will give us feedback on how well our model is and let us make improvements to it.",

The outcome is a continuous value.\nClassification: This is when the response is a categorical value, such as Yes/No. As an example, we can consider classifying Yes/No whether a person has \\(Hypertension\\) or not using predictors \\(Age\\) and \\(BMI\\).\n\nInference (Secondary in this course): Which predictors are associated with the response, and how strong is the association?\n\nPrediction model example: Suppose the model is described as \\(MeanBloodPressure = f(Age,BMI)=20 + 3 \\cdot Age - .2 \\cdot BMI\\). Each variable has a relationship to the outcome: an increase of \\(Age\\) by 1 will lead to an increase of \\(MeanBloodPressure\\) by 3.

    "text": "2.2 The conceptual example, in more depth\nLet’s walk through our conceptual example again, but in more depth, and with code examples. This will illustrate the complexity and the strategies involved in the Machine Learning roadmap we will explore carefully throughout the course.\n\n2.2.1 Visualizing the outcome\nBuilding a sound machine learning model requires careful understanding of the data, and we often start looking at the response variable.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom formulaic import model_matrix\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nnhanes = pd.read_csv(\"classroom_data/NHANES.csv\")\nnhanes.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\nnhanes['MeanBloodPressure'] = nhanes['BPDiaAve'] + (nhanes['BPSysAve'] - nhanes['BPDiaAve']) / 3 \n\nplt.clf()\ng = sns.displot(x=\"MeanBloodPressure\", data=nhanes)\ng.refline(x=70, color='r', linestyle='--')\ng.refline(x=90, color='r', linestyle='--')\nplt.show()\n\n&lt;Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the \\(MeanBloodPressure\\) is fairly symmetrically distributed. A person has normal blood pressure if their \\(MeanBloodPressure\\) is between values of 70 and ~90, which we have shown in the dotted vertical lines. There seems to be more people with elevated blood pressure, as there are more counts above 80 than below 80.\n\n\n\nMean Arterial Pressure\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nHypotension\n&lt;70\n\n\nNormal\n70-92\n\n\nStage 1 Hypertension\n92-96\n\n\nStage 2 Hypertension\n&gt;96\n\n\n\nUsually, a symmetric, continuous distribution for the response variable is a great way to start the machine learning modeling process, as a lot of models assume a symmetric, continuous distribution for the model to perform well.\nIf the response distribution is strongly skewed, then we may want to perform mathematical transformations fix it.\nIf the response distribution has multiple peaks (multi-modal), we may want to perform mathematical transformations, or consider reformulate the problem as a (multi-class) classification problem, if the interpretation makes sense.\n\n\n2.2.2 Splitting the data\nOur dataset has 7832 data points:\n\nprint(nhanes.shape)\n\n(7832, 77)\n\n\nIn Machine Learning, we need to carefully allocate how we want to use our data. In the machine learning model development process, we reserve some of the data, called the Training Set to allow the model learn from the data, and reserve the rest of the data, called the Testing Set to allow the model to be tested on new, unseen data.\nA logistical and psychological challenge of Machine Learning is to not have the model know anything about the Testing Set as you develop it. This is because as the model learns from any data, it will learn to recognize its patterns, and sometimes it will recognize patterns that are only specific to this data and not reproducible anywhere else. This is why we have a separate, unseen testing set to see if the model will generalize its performance.\nIn the previous section, we looked at the response data of the entire dataset, because if we don’t have a lot of data and if the distribution has multiple peaks, we may consider splitting data more carefully.\nBelow, we split the entire data randomlly into Training and Testing sets, giving 80% of the data to Training, and 20% of the data to Testing. There are other ways of splitting data to consider, in scenarios such as:\n\nTime series data\nSpatial data\nThe response data is small has multiple peaks\n\nbut random splitting will suffice for this example.\n\nnhanes_train, nhanes_test = train_test_split(nhanes, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nAnd let’s look at the number of data points after splitting:\n\nprint(\"Training size:\", nhanes_train.shape)\nprint(\"Testing size:\", nhanes_test.shape)\n\nTraining size: (6265, 77)\nTesting size: (1567, 77)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis\nNow, using only the Training Set, we try to discern which variables might be good predictors of our response, as well as how they relate - is it linear, nonlinear, or something else? There are many ways to pick predictors for a model, ranging from visual discernment to entirely quantitative methods, and we will be more comprehensive later in this course, but we will start with Exploratory Data Analysis.\nLet’s look at the relationship between \\(MeanBloodPressure\\) and potential predictor \\(BMI\\). We add a smooth line fit to the scatterplot, because it shows the average trend between these two variables. The black dotted lines are the ranges of healthy mean blood pressure from our response histogram.\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.regplot(y=\"MeanBloodPressure\", x=\"BMI\", data=nhanes_train, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.2}, line_kws={'color':\"r\"})\nax.axhline(y=70, color='black', linestyle='--')\nax.axhline(y=90, color='black', linestyle='--')\nax.set_xlim([10, 50])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, great, it looks like when someone’s BMI is higher, then it is more likely they have higher mean blood pressure.\nLet’s look at \\(Age\\):\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.regplot(y=\"MeanBloodPressure\", x=\"Age\", data=nhanes_train, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.2}, line_kws={'color':\"r\"})\nax.axhline(y=70, color='black', linestyle='--')\nax.axhline(y=90, color='black', linestyle='--')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a similar trend. How about \\(Gender\\)?\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.boxplot(x=\"Gender\", y=\"MeanBloodPressure\", data=nhanes)\nax.axhline(y=70, color='black', linestyle='--')\nax.axhline(y=90, color='black', linestyle='--')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMales tend to have a higher \\(MeanBloodPressure\\). Let’s look at one more, \\(DirectChol\\):\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.regplot(y=\"MeanBloodPressure\", x=\"DirectChol\", data=nhanes, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1}, line_kws={'color':\"r\"})\nax.axhline(y=70, color='black', linestyle='--')\nax.axhline(y=90, color='black', linestyle='--')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has a more nonlinear trend to it.\nGiven our (very brief) Exploratory Data Analysis, let’s pick a few predictors that seem promising: \\(BMI\\), \\(Age\\), \\(Gender\\).\n\n\n2.2.4 Correlations and Interactions\nBesides looking at the single predictors vs. the response, we also need to how the predictors relate to each other:\n\nSome predictors may be highly correlated with each other, so adding them to the model doesn’t give the model more information to work with.\nIt is possible that multiple predictors can have an synergestic effect on the outcome; their effect on the outcome occurs jointly - this is called an Interaction.\n\nIn the homework exercise you will do some data visualization work to see if can find some patterns of correlations and interactions in the data. Note that these trends are not mutually exclusive: Correlation is about how predictors X and Y relate to each other; Interaction is about how predictors X and Y together affect Z (the outcome).\n\n2.2.4.1 Exercise: Correlations\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.regplot(y=\"Age\", x=\"BMI\", data=nhanes, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1}, line_kws={'color':\"r\"})\nax.set_xlim([10, 50])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4.2 Exercise: Interactions\n\nplt.clf()\nax = sns.lmplot(y=\"MeanBloodPressure\", x=\"BMI\", hue=\"Gender\", data=nhanes, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1})\nax.set(xlim=(10, 50)) \nplt.show()\n\n&lt;Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes&gt;",

In our testing set, we already know all the values of the predictors and outcomes, so to simulate a realistic scenario, we feed the predictor to the model, let it make a prediction, and compare it to the true outcome.\nWhen we compare the predicted outcome vs. true outcome, we need to use a metric to compare the two quantities. Here are two popular metrics:\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): the average of the absolute difference between predicted vs. true outcome. This scale of this metric is the same as the outcome’s scale, which is easy to interpret.\nMean Squared Error (MSE): the average of the squared difference between predicted vs. true outcome. The scale of this metric is harder to interpret, but it has very nice mathematical properties for the model fitting that it remains very popular.\n\nLet’s look at our MAE of our model on the test data:\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\ny_test, X_test = model_matrix(\"MeanBloodPressure ~ Age + BMI + Gender\", nhanes_test)\ny_test_predicted = linear_reg.predict(X_test)\n\nmean_absolute_error(y_test_predicted, y_test)\n\n8.646477228125601\n\n\nOkay, on average our model is off by 8.64 on the scale of \\(MeanBloodPressure\\).\nLet’s visualize this:\n\nplt.clf()\nplt.scatter(y_test_predicted, y_test, alpha=.5)\nplt.axline((70, 70), slope=1, color='r', linestyle='--')\nplt.xlabel('Predicted MeanBloodPressure')\nplt.ylabel('True MeanBloodPressure')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we race ahead….there’s a lot of new Python data structures that we are working with in this course.

    "text": "2.6 Review of Data Structures\nWe will be seeing a lot of different data structures in this course beyond DataFrames, Series, and Lists. So let’s review how we think about learning new data structures to make our lives easier when we encounter new data structures.\nLet’s review the List data structure. For any data structure, we ask the following:\n\nWhat does it contain (in terms of data)?\nWhat can it do (in terms of functions)?\n\nAnd if it “makes sense” to us, then it is well-designed data structure.\nFormally, a data structure in Python (also known as an Object) may contain the following:\n\nValue that holds the essential data for the data structure.\nAttributes that hold subset or additional data for the data structure.\nFunctions called Methods that are for the data structure and have to take in the variable referenced as an input.\n\nLet’s see how this applies to the List:\n\nValue: the contents of the list, such as [2, 3, 4].\nAttributes that store additional values: Not relevant for lists.\nMethods that can be used on the object: my_list.append(x)\n\nHow about Dataframe?\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional spreadsheet of the dataframe.\nAttributes that store additional values: df.shape gives the number of rows and columns. df.my_col_name access the column called “my_col_name”.\nMethods that can be used on the object: df.merge(other_df, on=“column_name”)\n\nFeel free to look at the cheatsheet on data structures from Intro to Python to refresh yourself.\n\n2.6.1 NumPy\nA new Data Structure we will work with in this course is NumPy’s ndarray (“n-dimensional array”) data structure. It is commonly referred as “NumPy Array”. It is very similar to a Dataframe, but has the following characteristics for building machine learning models:\n\nAll elements are homogeneous and numeric.\nThere are no column or row names.\nMathematical operations are optimized to be fast.\n\nSo, let’s see some examples:\n\nValue: the 2-dimensional numerical table. It actually can be any dimension, but we will just work with 1-dimensional (similar to a List) and 2-dimensional.\nAttributes that store additional values:\n\nTwo-dimensional subsetting, similar to lists: data[:5, :3] subsets for for the first 5 rows and first three columns. data[:5, [0, 2, 3]] subsets for the first 5 rows and 1st, 3rd, and 4th columns.\ndata.shape gives the shape of the NumPy Array. data.ndim will tell you the number of dimensions of the NumPy Array.\n\nMethods that can be used on the object:\n\ndata.sum(axis=0) sums over rows, data.sum(axis=1) sums over columns.\n\n\nFor this course, we often load in a dataset in the Pandas Dataframe format, and then once we pick the our outcome and predictors, we will transform the Dataframe into an NumPy Array, such as this line of code we saw earlier: y, X = model_matrix(\"Hypertension ~ BMI\", nhanes). We specify our outcome, predictor, and Dataframe for the model_matrix() function, and the outputs are two NumPy Arrays, one for the outcome, and one for the predictors. Any downstream Machine Learning modeling work off the NumPy Arrays y and X.\nMore introduction can be found on NumPy’s tutorial guide.\n\n\n2.6.2 What is this data structure?\nIf you are not sure about what your variable’s data structure, use the type() function, such as type(mystery_data) and it will tell you.",

For NHANES, this could be the entire US population.\nSample: A smaller collection of individual units that the researcher has selected to study. For NHANES, this could be a random sampling of the US population.\nIn Machine Learning problems, we often like to take two, non-overlapping samples from the population: the Training Set, and the Test Set. We train our model using the Training Set, which gives us a function \\(f()\\) that relates the predictors to the outcome.

    "text": "3.2 Generalizability of a model\nWhen we look how the model performs in Classification and Prediction on the training and test data, we are asking how generalizable a model is. Usually we want our model to perform well on unseen, testing data that also represent the population.\nWe saw that in the first exercise, the Training and Testing Error looked different - why?\n\nThere is always going to be some variation, because Training and Test are samples from the population, as we discussed above.\nThe model was trained on the Training Set, so the prediction is going to naturally perform better than data it has never seen before on the Testing Set.\n\nHow do we interpret the difference between Training Error and Testing Error?\n\n\nTo see how generalizable a model is, let’s look at a problem in prediction, not classification. The underlying principles of model generalizability applies to both prediction and classification, but it is generally easier to visualize this concept in prediction models.\n\n3.2.1 Underfitting and Overfitting a Prediction Model\nIn a prediction model, the outcome is continuous. Instead of yes/no for \\(Hyptertension\\), we will use the clinical metric of Mean Arterial Pressure \\(BloodPressure\\). Here is how to interpret the continuous value:\nThe prediction model we will use is called a Linear Model, in its basic form draws a straight line as a line of “best fit” for given the data.\nTo evaluate the model, we will let the model make prediction given the input variable. This prediction is on the scale of \\(BloodPressure\\), so there’s no to draw a Decision Boundary in prediction problems. To examine the accuracy, we will look at the mean squared error between the true \\(BloodPressure\\) and the predicted \\(BloodPressure\\).

This is an example of Underfitting, where our model failed to capture the complexity of the data in both the Training and Testing Set.\nAfter degree 6, we see that the Training Error is low, but the Testing Error is huge! This is an example of Overfitting, in which our model fitted the shape of of the training set so well that it fails to generalize to the testing set.\n\nWe want to find a model that is “just right” that doesn’t underfit or overfit the data. Usually, as the model becomes more flexible, the Training Error keeps lowering, and the Testing Error will lower a bit before increasing. It seems that our ideal prediction model is around a polynomial of degree 5 or 6, with the minimal Testing Error.\nHere is another illustration of the phenomena, using synthetic controlled data:\nOn the left shows the Training Data in black dots. Then, three models are displayed: linear regression (orange line), two other models of increasing complexity in blue and green.\nOn the right shows the training error (grey curve), testing error (red curve), and where each of the three models on the left land in the error rate with their respective colors.\n\n\n\nSource: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Ch. 2, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Roebert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor.\n\n\nLastly, we recommend examining interactive tutorial: https://mlu-explain.github.io/bias-variance/\nHopefully you start to see the importance of examining the Testing Error instead of the Training Error to evaluate our model. A highly flexible data will overfit the model and make it seem like the Training Error is small, but it will not generalize to the Testing data, which will have Testing Error.\n\n\n3.2.2 Underfitting and Overfitting a Classification Model\nLet’s do the same exercise for a Classification model.
